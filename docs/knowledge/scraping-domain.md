# Scraping domain (boards, company-scoped, aggregator)

Last updated: 2026-07-01

Describes the job-scraping subsystem: board registry (21 active scrapers), company-scoped ATS boards, and the Adzuna/JSearch aggregator. **Shape only** — refer to source for implementation detail. See `docs/SCRAPING_ENDPOINTS.md` for verified endpoint snapshots (external reconnaissance) and `docs/knowledge/decision-records/adr-026-retire-anti-bot-boards.md` for the retirement rationale.

## Board registry & catalog

- **`Scraper` trait** — `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/boards/mod.rs`. Every board implements `Scraper: Clone + Send + Sync + Debug`.
- **`SCRAPERS`** — registry of all enabled scrapers (built at compile time, no runtime plugin system).
- **`BOARD_IDS`** — const array in `packages/shared/src/schemas/index.ts`; lists all scrapeable boards (21 total, `aggregator` counted once among them). `AGGREGATOR_BOARD_ID = 'aggregator'` is the stable catalog id for the Adzuna/JSearch provider.
- **Catalog** — `ScraperEngine::catalog()` (Rust) → `boards.catalog()` IPC → `useBoardsCatalog()` hook. Exposes per-board metadata:
  - `id` (slug)
  - `name`, `icon` (UI)
  - `auth` — `guest` / `optional` / `required` (affects UI gate + backend skip logic)
  - `requiresCompany` — boolean; when true, scrape form shows a "Companies" field (new in PR #464)
  - `mode` — `http` or `browser`

## Company-scoped boards (PR #464)

Company-scoped ATS boards require company slugs instead of free-text keyword searches. Each board declares `requiresCompany=true` in the catalog metadata and implements its own fanout and filtering logic. For the authoritative list of boards and per-board limits, see `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/boards/` (each module) and the registry `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/boards/mod.rs` (`SCRAPERS`).

### BoardSearchInput contract

- **`companies?: string[]`** — optional list of company slugs (e.g. `["stripe", "notion"]`). Populated only when scraping a `requiresCompany` board.
- Generated from `packages/shared/src/ipc/contracts/scrape.ts` → Zod → `pnpm gen:ipc` → `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/ipc_contracts/scrape.rs`.

### Skip state: `needs-company`

When a company-scoped board is selected with an empty `companies` list:

- Backend: skip the board, emit `BoardScrapeSummary { skipped: Some("needs-company") }`
- Renderer: display a sign-in/config prompt (same pattern as `needs-login`)

### Hardening (PR #467)

- **SSRF guard:** Personio & Recruitee validate company slug as a DNS label (alphanumeric + hyphen, max 63 chars)
- **Per-company dedup:** SmartRecruiters + Personio deduplicate results within each company (partial failure isolation: one company's error doesn't block others)
- **Consistent IDs:** `personio::make_job_id(company, position_id)` ensures job IDs match across ingestion paths (scrape + URL resolve)

### PR 1 of the ATS-boards program (2026-07-01): pinpoint, rippling, breezy, bamboohr

Four more company-scoped boards, endpoint-reconnaissance-ported from `santifer/career-ops` (MIT) — **not yet re-verified live**; see `docs/SCRAPING_ENDPOINTS.md` for the unverified-endpoint caveat and per-board detail.

- **Pinpoint** (`{slug}.pinpointhq.com/postings.json`) and **Breezy HR** (`{slug}.breezy.hr/json`) — subdomain-scoped, DNS-label SSRF guard (same shape as Personio). Neither response has a stable job id, so the (per-company deduped) posting URL doubles as the id.
- **Rippling** (`api.rippling.com/platform/api/ats/v1/board/{slug}/jobs`) — fixed API host, slug is a percent-encoded **path segment**, not a hostname. The response `url` field is host-locked to `ats.rippling.com` before use (an untrusted response could otherwise inject arbitrary URLs into `JobPosting.url`).
- **BambooHR** (`{slug}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`) — subdomain-scoped, DNS-label SSRF guard; has a real `id` field (accepted as either JSON number or string), so the job URL is _constructed_ by the scraper (`.../careers/{id}`), not taken from the response.
- Each board's response→`JobPosting` mapping is a standalone `pub fn parse_<board>_response(...)`, unit-testable against a JSON fixture without a network round-trip (mirrors Personio's `parse_xml_feed`).

### PR 2 of the aggregator-boards program (2026-07-01): The Muse

**The Muse** (`themuse`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/boards/themuse/mod.rs`) — `requires_company()` stays `false` (default): it's a **keyword aggregator**, not a company-scoped ATS board. Same career-ops reconnaissance provenance and unverified-endpoint caveat as PR 1.

- The Muse's public API (`www.themuse.com/api/public/jobs?page={n}`) has no free-text keyword param — only `category`/`level`/`location`/`company`/`page`. The scraper browses the feed and filters client-side (title+company substring for `query`, location substring for `location`), the same convention as Remotive/RemoteOK/Arbeitnow.
- Pagination: response includes `page_count`; the scraper reads it from page 0 and iterates up to `min(input.pages, page_count, 5)` — 5-page cap matches Arbeitnow's `input.pages.clamp(1, 5)`, not career-ops's 100-page crawl.
- No stable job id in the response, so the (validated `^https?://`) posting URL doubles as the id — same precedent as Breezy/Pinpoint.

## Retired boards (Glassdoor, Indeed, Xing, StepStone, Workday)

These five boards were retired as direct scrapers (ADR-026, 2026-06-21). Their Rust modules are deleted; the registry went from 21 → 16 boards. Coverage is now provided by the Aggregator. The single-job import resolvers (`scrape_url::canonical_job_url` for Indeed, `scrape_url::try_workday`) and the dormant `board_login`/credential machinery are **deliberately kept** — see ADR-026 for the full keep-list and rationale.

## Aggregator board (Adzuna + JSearch)

**Purpose:** Cover anti-bot sites (Indeed, Glassdoor, Xing, Workday, StepStone) that return empty results or errors when self-scraped. Uses a provider registry pattern: Adzuna (primary, free) with JSearch (paid fallback, invoked only on Adzuna errors).

**Full-description resolution:** Aggregator sources return short snippets; the detail pane auto-fetches full descriptions on open by following redirect chains and re-dispatching to named-board handlers. See `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/http/html_to_markdown.rs` and `scraping/boards/aggregator/mod.rs` for fetch logic, IP-guarding, and snippet-vs-resolved floor semantics.

**Keys and configuration:**

- Adzuna and JSearch API keys are stored in the OS keyring and never logged (encrypted at rest, decrypted only in Rust).
- Settings → Jobs exposes UI to enter/remove credentials.
- Keys are read on-demand via `credentials::read_credential` (module at `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/credentials/mod.rs`).

**Provider details, endpoints, and fallback logic:** see `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/boards/aggregator/mod.rs` (AdzunaProvider, JSearchProvider, and JobProvider trait).

**Adzuna country-code limitation (PR #483):**

Adzuna's API is country-scoped with a fixed market allowlist; see `ADZUNA_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES` in the aggregator module. Unsupported countries trigger a diagnostic error (not silent empty) that surfaces as `BoardScrapeSummary.error` with JSearch as fallback. Autopilot skip/error reasons surface in the run step log via `scrape_diagnostics`.

**Behavior:**

- **Keyless:** Returns empty results (never crashes; logged as warning).
- **Configured-failed:** If a provider is configured (keys present) and fails, diagnostic error surfaces as `BoardScrapeSummary.error` (not silent empty); fallback to next provider.
- **Unsupported country (Adzuna only):** Pre-request guard rejects before HTTP invocation; error includes remedy (add JSearch key for global coverage).
- **Empty results:** Legitimate (do NOT trigger fallback to next provider; only errors do).
- **Cancellation:** Pre-fallback cancel signal skips the paid provider entirely.

## Trust assessment (PR 3, 2026-07-01)

Every finalized `JobPosting` carries a **ghost-job / trust signal** — a pure,
non-blocking enrichment ported from `santifer/career-ops`'s
`providers/_trust-validator.mjs` (MIT). V1 is **flag-only: enrich, never
drop** — a low score never removes a posting, it only lowers the level for a
renderer badge (separate frontend pass). No config/enabled toggle; always
computed.

- **Module:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/trust/mod.rs` —
  `pub fn assess_trust(url: &str, company: &str) -> TrustAssessment` (pure,
  no I/O, no new deps — `reqwest::Url`, i.e. the `url` crate reqwest
  re-exports). All helpers `pub(crate)` for fixture testing.
- **Shape:** `TrustAssessment { score: u8, level: TrustLevel, flags: Vec<TrustFlag> }`.
  `score` starts at 100 and is only ever decreased, clamped `0..=100`.
  `level`: `>=90 High`, `>=60 Medium`, else `Low`. The renderer `TrustBadge` only displays for `'medium'` or `'low'`; `'high'` renders no badge (no badge = trusted, noise-free).
- **Flags** — four signals, each decrements `score` by a penalty amount (see
  `SUSPICIOUS_DOMAINS`, `ATS_ALLOWLIST`, and `finish()` in
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/trust/mod.rs` for penalty magnitudes
  and thresholds):
  - `MissingApplyUrl` (early return) — `url` empty/whitespace.
  - `InvalidUrl` (early return) — `url` doesn't parse or scheme isn't `http(s)`.
  - `SuspiciousDomain` — host is a URL shortener (see `SUSPICIOUS_DOMAINS`
    constant).
  - `CompanyDomainMismatch` — `company` is non-empty, the host isn't on the
    ATS allowlist, and the host doesn't plausibly name the company (normalized
    slug or a ≥3-char word match).
- **ATS allowlist** — never raises `CompanyDomainMismatch`. See `ATS_ALLOWLIST`
  constant in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/trust/mod.rs`; includes the
  standard ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.) plus our 21 `SCRAPERS` boards
  where `JobPosting.url` is systematically the BOARD's own domain rather than the
  employer's, plus the Adzuna aggregator (whose redirect host is a constant
  `api.adzuna.com` — country code is a path segment, not a subdomain).
- **`company_matches_host` is an unanchored substring heuristic**, not
  label-boundary matching — see the doc comment in `trust/mod.rs` for the
  known both-direction trade-off (misses a brand-embedding phishing host like
  `amazon-careers.xyz`; a short/generic company word can over-match).
  Deliberately deferred for V1 since the flag is advisory/non-gating; anchor
  it if a future flow ever gates behavior on `level`.
- **Wiring — three call sites** (every other `JobPosting`/`FoundJob`
  construction site is untouched; `JobPosting.trust` is NOT a dedicated
  struct field, to avoid touching all ~21 board literals — it's attached into
  the existing `#[serde(flatten)] extra: HashMap<String, Value>` channel, the
  same one salary/remote-status metadata already uses):
  - `ScraperEngine::run_one`'s streaming wrapper
    (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/engine/mod.rs`) — the funnel every
    board's streamed item passes through before reaching either caller's
    `on_item` (manual scrape → `PostingsCache` + `job.stream`; Autopilot's
    _live_ scrape stream → `SCRAPE_ITEM`).
  - `scrape_url::resolve()` (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/scrape_url/mod.rs`)
    — the single-URL resolver shared by the `scrape_url`/`scrape_resolve_url`
    commands and the extension-bridge import (import doesn't persist `trust`
    — it only ever writes an `ApplicationMeta`, not the postings/`JobPosting`
    contract).
  - `commands::autopilot::autopilot_run`'s `postings → FoundJob` `.map()`
    (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/autopilot.rs`) — the **persisted**
    `AutopilotFoundJob` record the badge UI actually reads is built from the
    board's separately-returned `Vec<JobPosting>`, not the streamed copy the
    engine wrapper attaches to, so it calls `assess_trust` directly (a pure,
    cheap call — no need to round-trip through `extra`). `FoundJob.trust` is
    `Option<TrustAssessment>` (unlike `JobPosting`'s always-`Some`): a run
    recorded before this field existed deserializes with `None`
    (`#[serde(default)]`), every run recorded from here on sets `Some(..)`.
- **Contract:** `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` — `JobTrustAssessment`,
  `JobPosting.trust?`, and `AutopilotFoundJob.trust?`. None are
  Zod-schema-derived (like the rest of those two interfaces), so none are
  `gen:ipc`-generated; kept hand-in-sync with the Rust serde shapes, same as
  every other field on both interfaces.

## Scrape results persistence (PR #463)

Results now persist across navigation thanks to React Query + backend cache:

- **Backend:** `PostingsCache` in Rust is the source of truth (populated as streamed results arrive)
- **Frontend:** Throttled `invalidatePostings()` on `job.stream` event (~1 ms throttle; eager on first item of new search)
- **Hydration:** React Query re-fetches cache on component remount → results reappear

## Full-description resolution on detail-pane open

**Aggregator short snippets → full descriptions:** Adzuna search API returns snippets (~200–500 chars). Detail pane auto-fetches on open when aggregator source + description < 700 chars, following the redirect chain and re-dispatching named-board handlers on the final URL. If the resolved text is meaningfully longer, it replaces the snippet; otherwise the snippet floor is kept. Redirect following is IP-guarded per-hop (closes DNS-rebinding TOCTOU); 429/login-wall/error returns Ok(None) and the snippet is retained.

- **Resolver:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/scrape.rs: scrape_resolve_url(req)` — public command invoked by detail pane
- **Re-dispatch:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/scraping/scrape_url/mod.rs: resolve_full_description()` — follows redirect and re-dispatches handlers per final URL
- **Pane gate:** `apps/desktop/src/renderer/features/jobs/components/JobDetailPane/index.tsx` — on-open resolve if (isAggregatorSource && descLength < 700); keep-longer merge logic
- **Description mutation & re-score:** Backend command `scrape_update_description(id, text)` writes resolved text to the live `PostingsCache`. The frontend's `MatchScoresProvider` holds a reactive `requested` set; when the description is updated, the per-job match score is re-computed on-demand via `useJobMatchScore` (single-job scoring, not batch). See IPC contract in `packages/shared/src/ipc/contracts/scrape.ts`.
