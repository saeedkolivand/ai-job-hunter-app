//! "Suggest answers for this form" (`answers.suggest` → `answers.suggest.result`)
//! — the headline replay verb (extension roadmap PR 6). Fuzzy-match each EMPTY
//! question label the popup's questions-mode collector scanned against EVERY
//! stored [`ApplicationAnswer`] across ALL applications, and return the best
//! per-question match. Split out of `mod.rs` per the R8 LOC cap (mirrors
//! `answers_save.rs`/`status_update.rs`'s module split); `resolve_*`/`handle_*`
//! pure/impure split mirrors those siblings.
//!
//! **Consent-gate boundary**: a suggestion carries the user's OWN past answer
//! text desktop→extension — the same PII-adjacent consent class as
//! `profile.get`'s contact fields — so it rides the SAME assisted-autofill
//! opt-in (`BridgeState::autofill_enabled`), never a separate gate.
//!
//! **Read-only, no new store method**: `applications/mod.rs` sits at the R8
//! hard LOC cap, so this module reads via the ALREADY-public, read-only
//! `ApplicationStore::list()` rather than adding a store method there — the
//! read lives here, in the bridge module, exactly as the PR-6 handoff flagged.
//!
//! **Pure matcher**: [`match_questions`] takes plain [`AnswerCandidate`]
//! literals (no store, no `AppHandle`, no timing) — normalize
//! ([`crate::applications::normalize_question`], shared with `answers.save`'s
//! dedup) + token-Jaccard similarity, thresholded, tied-break by score then
//! most-recent `updated_at`. Deterministic: the same inputs always produce the
//! same outputs — no AI, no egress, no randomness.
