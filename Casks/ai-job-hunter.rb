# Homebrew cask for AI Job Hunter Assistant.
#
# Releases ship signed macOS .dmg artifacts, so this cask is installable. The
# repo doubles as its own tap (it has this Casks/ directory):
#   brew tap saeedkolivand/ai-job-hunter-assistant-app https://github.com/saeedkolivand/ai-job-hunter-assistant-app
#   brew install --cask ai-job-hunter
#
# Maintenance:
#   • `version` tracks the latest release that ships macOS .dmg artifacts (the
#     installer build is manual, so not every release has them). The dmg assets
#     are named "AI-Job-Hunter-Assistant_<version>_<arch>.dmg".
#   • When a new build publishes dmgs, bump `version` and refresh both per-arch
#     `sha256` values — `brew bump-cask-pr` does this, or read the assets'
#     sha256 digests from `gh release view v<version> --json assets`.
