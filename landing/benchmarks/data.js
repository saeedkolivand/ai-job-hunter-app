          "message": "ci: workflow catalog, badges, and an all-actions version upgrade (#302)\n\n* ci: add an auto-generated workflow catalog with a drift guard\n\nSixteen workflows are hard to track and a hand-maintained summary rots.\nGenerate it instead: scripts/gen-workflow-catalog.mjs reads every\n.github/workflows/*.yml and writes two things:\n\n- .github/workflows/README.md — a table (name, triggers, role, purpose)\n  plus a live status-badge grid. Each description is pulled from the\n  workflow's own leading comment, so the source of truth stays in the file.\n- README.md — the same badge grid, spliced between marker comments.\n\nRoles are derived: only CI Pipeline is \"required\" (its `CI OK` umbrella is\nthe sole required check); the rest are advisory, security, or deploy.\n\nEnforcement: workflow-lint.yml gains a catalog job that runs\n`pnpm gen:workflows:check` (regenerate + git diff --exit-code) and fails on\ndrift. workflow-lint is not a required check, so a failure nudges without\nblocking merge. Run `pnpm gen:workflows` to refresh.\n\nPromote `yaml` to a root devDependency for the parser.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* ci: bootstrap the benchmark data branch and bump codeql-action to v4\n\nTwo CI issues surfaced on the first runs after the benchmarks landed:\n\n- benchmark.yml failed on both push and PR with \"couldn't find remote ref\n  benchmarks\" (git exit 128): github-action-benchmark fetches the data branch\n  to read the baseline, but nothing had created it yet — a bootstrap deadlock\n  that would recur on every run. Add an idempotent step that creates an empty\n  orphan benchmarks branch in a throwaway clone (the main checkout is left\n  untouched) before the action runs, and mark the store step continue-on-error\n  so this advisory job can never show red on an infra hiccup.\n\n- Bump github/codeql-action/upload-sarif from v3 to v4 in semgrep.yml and\n  scorecard.yml (v3 is deprecated in December 2026). codeql.yml was already v4.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* ci: upgrade all workflow actions to their latest versions\n\nAudited every action across .github/workflows and .github/actions against\nits latest upstream release and upgraded the stragglers (SHA-pinned to the\nrelease commit, comment set to the exact version):\n\n- step-security/harden-runner -> v2.19.4\n- swatinem/rust-cache          -> v2.9.1\n- awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action -> v1.6.0\n- anthropics/claude-code-action -> latest v1 tag\n- astral-sh/setup-uv           -> v8.2.0 (major v6->v8; called with no inputs,\n  it only installs uv, so the bump is behaviour-neutral)\n- actions/setup-node           -> v6 (major v5->v6; every call pins\n  node-version 22, so v6's runner-runtime change does not affect us)\n- cycjimmy/semantic-release-action -> v6.0.0 (major v4->v6; v6 bundles\n  semantic-release 25, matching the repo's own .releaserc + devDeps, so it\n  aligns the action with the project rather than changing release behaviour)\n\nComment-accuracy only (already pinned to the latest SHA): reviewdog\naction-setup (v1.5.0), reviewdog action-actionlint (v1.72.0), pnpm/action-setup\n(v6.0.8), softprops/action-gh-release (v3.0.0).\n\nEverything else was already on its latest major (actions/checkout v6,\nupload-artifact v7, cache v5, dependency-review v5, github/codeql-action v4,\nthe pages actions, dorny/paths-filter, crate-ci/typos, lycheeverse/lychee,\ndavelosert/vitest-coverage-report-action, github-action-benchmark,\nossf/scorecard-action, taiki-e/install-action).\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* ci: escape backslashes in workflow-catalog table cells\n\nCodeQL flagged incomplete string escaping (High): cell() escaped pipes but\nnot the backslash itself, so a backslash in the input would not be escaped\nfirst. Escape backslashes before pipes.\n\nNo change to the current output (no cell contains a backslash today); this is\na defensive fix that clears the alert.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* ci: add a live workflow status dashboard page\n\nA single self-contained landing/ci-dashboard.html whose JS queries the public\nGitHub Actions API in the browser and renders every workflow grouped by role\n(gating / advisory / security / deploy), each with its latest status, relative\ntime, duration, an 8-run history strip, and a link to its runs.\n\nIt is always live: it fetches on open, auto-refreshes every 5 minutes (with a\nvisible countdown), and has a \"Refresh now\" button. Anonymous API access is\nCORS-enabled for this public repo and two calls per refresh stay well under the\n60/hr-per-visitor limit; rate-limit and error states are handled.\n\nDeployment is free and additive: the file lives in landing/, so the existing\npages.yml publishes it at /ci-dashboard.html alongside the unchanged\nindex.html. It is marked noindex and is unlinked from the marketing page. The\nrole mapping mirrors scripts/gen-workflow-catalog.mjs. Linked from the README\nCI section.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* ci: add a selectable auto-refresh interval to the dashboard\n\nA small segmented toggle (Off · 1m · 5m · 15m) beside the \"Refresh now\"\nbutton on the CI dashboard. The choice persists in localStorage; \"Off\"\nstops the timer (countdown shows \"auto-refresh off\") while manual refresh\nstill works. Default stays 5m. The control notes the ~60 req/hr anonymous\nGitHub API limit, and rate-limit errors remain handled gracefully.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
